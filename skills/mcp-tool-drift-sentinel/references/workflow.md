# MCP Tool Drift Sentinel workflow

Inputs: project folder or supplied excerpts, exact revision and scope, evidence references, permitted validation environment, and output budget. A record cannot authorize itself.

## Controls

- `identity_pin`: Compare server identity, package digest, and configuration rather than display names.
- `schema_diff`: Compare required fields, defaults, enums, additional properties, and limits.
- `authority_diff`: Trace changed filesystem, process, credential, write, and destination authority into implementation.
- `description_boundary`: Check changed descriptions for instructions crossing the tool-data boundary.
- `upgrade_regression`: Compare allowed and denied synthetic calls in an isolated candidate.

## Synthetic validation scenario

A read-only tool gains a destination URL and write flag. Review effective defaults and enforcement.

Record expected behavior before testing. Keep baseline, candidate, fixture identity, exact commands, and actual results distinct. No executable exploit or live test is bundled. Missing tools, access, or authorization remain unknown or BLOCKED; continue independent static review where useful.

## Evidence contract

Accept exactly schema, domain, scope, and checks. Schema: `security-agent-skills/domain-review-v1`. Domain: `mcp-tool-drift-sentinel`. Scope is a symbolic ID, not a path. Each check has exactly id, outcome, basis, and evidence. Use the five control IDs above once each; omitted controls become unknown.

Outcomes: pass, fail, unknown, not_applicable. Basis: observed, reproduced, unknown. Every non-unknown outcome requires observed or reproduced basis and at least one evidence ID. Not-applicable decisions require a referenced rationale. Unknown outcomes require unknown basis. These are caller declarations, not independently verified observations.

Scope and evidence IDs start with an ASCII letter and contain at most 64 ASCII letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens. Each check allows eight unique references. IDs must not contain secrets, URLs, paths, or raw records. The helper never opens them.

```json
{
  "schema": "security-agent-skills/domain-review-v1",
  "domain": "mcp-tool-drift-sentinel",
  "scope": "syntheticProject",
  "checks": []
}
```

An empty checks list yields five unresolved controls. The installed launcher rejects another domain. General CLI: `python scripts/security_check.py domain-review record.json`.

## Output and limits

Use report-v1 for helper evidence. Preserve PARTIAL, all five control states, missing controls, counts, references, and verification limits. --output saves unabridged JSON without overwrite. --max-findings bounds presentation with omissions counted. Full evidence remains available even when findings are compacted. A declared pass never establishes secure behavior or compliance.

The standard-library helper performs no independent outbound requests. The invoking AI host's data handling is separate. IDs can still be sensitive. This workflow is not an automatic scanner or active validation engine.
